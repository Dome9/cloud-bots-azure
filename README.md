## What are Dome9 CloudBots?

Cloud-Bots is an auto remediation solution for Azure, built on top of
the CloudGuard Dome9 Continuous Compliance capabilities.

They can also be used standalone, without Dome9, to remedy issues in AWS
accounts. Details are included how to configure and trigger them.

## The Bots

Refer to [this](dome9CloudBots/bots/bots.md) file for a list of the
bots, what each one does, and an example of a rule that could be used to
trigger it.

# Deploy the CloudBots to your Azure accounts

To use the CloudBots in your Azure accounts, you must setup your account
and your Dome9 account.

## Setup your Azure subscriptions for CloudBots

Follow these steps to configure your Azure subscriptions to use Dome9
CloudBots:

  - Install packages needed by the Cloudbots
  - Create a new Azure app registration for CloudBots
  - Optionally, create a SendGrid account to forward email notifications

    2.  Navigate to the locally cloned CloudBots directory and run the
        following command: `func init --docker`
    
    3.  Select *Python*.
    
    4.  Deploy the code to the remote Function App (this could take a
        while). Run the following command, replacing ${functionAppName}
        with the Function App name that was given in the previous step
        (5 (v)): `func azure functionapp publish ${functionAppName}
        --build-native-deps`
    
    5.  In the Azure portal, navigate to the Function App and then to
        *Configuration*.
    
    6.  Set the following environment variables. Click *New application

    7.  Click *Save*.

## Multiple Accounts

If you are deploying CloudBots on several Azure subscriptions, repeat
step 4 (Assign Roles), above, for each subscription.

# Setup your Dome9 account

On Dome9 you must add remediation tags to rules in a compliance ruleset.

## Configure the rules

Follow these steps in your Dome9 account to tag the compliance rules &
rulesets to use bots as a remediation step.

1.  In the Dome9 web app, navigate to the Rulesets page in the
    Compliance & Governance menu.

2.  Select or create a ruleset that will be used for the cloudbots.

3.  Select the rules for which you want to add a remediation step.

4.  In the Compliance Section add a row with the following string:
    `AUTO: <bot-name> <params>` where *bot-name* is the name of the bot,
    and *params* is a list of arguments for the bot (if any).
    
    For example, `AUTO: ec2_virtual_machine_stop` will run the bot to
    stop an EC2 instance.

## Configure a Continuous Compliance policy

Once the rules in the ruleset have been tagged for remediation, set up a
Continuous Compliance policy to run the ruleset, and send findings the
Azure function webhook.

1.  Navigate to the **Policies** page in the Compliance & Governance
    menu.
2.  Click **ADD POLICY** (on the right).
3.  Select the account from the list, then click **NEXT**, this will be
    the one account in which the bots are deployed.
4.  Select the ruleset from the list, then click **NEXT**.
5.  Click **ADD NOTIFICATION**.
6.  Select *Send to HTTP Endpoint* and enter the URL from the Function
    App and then click **SAVE**.

**Note:** Dome9 will send event messages to the webhook for new
findings. To send events for previous findings, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the **Policies** page.
2.  Find the ruleset and account in the list, and hover over the right
    of the row, then click on the *Send All Alerts* icon.
3.  Select the *webhook* Notification Type option, and the Notification
    Policy (the one created above), then click **SEND**. Dome9 will send
    event messages to the Azure function webhook.

# Update the CloudBots code

1.  Deployment
    1.  Clone the CloudBots Azure code from
        [GitHub](https://github.com/Dome9/cloud-bots-azure)
    2.  Navigate to the locally cloned CloudBots directory and run the
        following command: `func init --docker`
    3.  Select *Python*.
    4.  Deploy the code to the remote Function App (this could take a
        while). Run the following command, replacing ${functionAppName}
        with the Function App name that was given in the previous step
        (5 (v)): `func azure functionapp publish ${functionAppName}
        --build-native-deps`

# Log Collection for Troubleshooting

The cloudbots send log information to Dome9, that is used for
troubleshooting. By default, this is enabled for all bots. You can
disable this in your Azure account. Select the function, and set the
environment variable SEND\_LOGS to False. This will apply to all bots in
the account. By default, this is set to True, enabling logs.

Each account is controlled by the variable for the function configured
in that account.
