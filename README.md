# Setup your Dome9 account

On Dome9 you must add remediation tags to rules in a compliance ruleset

## Configure the rules

Follow these steps in your Dome9 account to tag the compliance rules &
rulesets to use bots as a remediation step.

1.  In the Dome9 console, navigate to the Rulesets page in the
    Compliance & Governance menu.

2.  Select the rules for which you want to add a remediation step.

3.  In the Compliance Section add a row with the following string:
    `AUTO: <bot-name> <params>` where *bot-name* is the name of the bot,
    and *params* is a list of arguments for the bot (if any).
    
    For example, `AUTO: ec2_stop_instance` will run the bot to stop an
    EC2 instance.

## Configure the Continuous Compliance policy

Once the rules in the ruleset have been tagged for remediation, set up a
Continuous Compliance policy to run the ruleset, and send findings to
the SNS.

1.  Navigate to the **Policies** page in the Compliance & Governance
    menu.
2.  Click **ADD POLICY** (on the right).
3.  Select the account from the list, then click **NEXT**, this will be the one account in which the bots are deployed.
4.  Select the ruleset from the list, then click **NEXT**.
5.  Click **ADD NOTIFICATION**.
6.  Select *Webhook integration* and enter the HTTP from the Function App and then click **SAVE**.

**Note:** Dome9 will send event messages to the SNS for new findings. To
send events for previous findings, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the **Policies** page.
2.  Find the ruleset and account in the list, and hover over the right
    of the row, then click on the *Send All Alerts* icon.
3.  Select the *SNS* Notification Type option, and the Notification
    Policy (the one created above), then click **SEND**. Dome9 will send
    event messages to the SNS for findings.

# Use the CloudBots without Dome9

You can use the CloudBots without a Dome9 account. In this case you must
send messages to the SNS for each event that requires remediation. The
message should have the following format:

    {
      "reportTime": "2018-03-20T05:40:42.043Z",
      "rule": {
        "name": "<name for rule>",
        "complianceTags": "AUTO: <bot-name>"
      },
      "status": "Failed",
      "account": {
        "id": "************"
      },
      "entity": {
        "accountNumber": "************",
        "id": "i-*****************",
        "name": "************",
        "region": "us_west_2",
      }
    }

where *account: id* and *accountNumber* is your Azure account number
*status* is marked *Failed*
*entity: id* is the id for the entity that failed the rule
